## Entropy Illusion

### Description:
The EVM does not have support for uncertainty/random number generation. Contracts may try to simulate uncertainty in a way that is in fact predictable and exploitable.

### Remediation:
Using external sources of randomness via oracles, e.g. Oraclize. Note that this approach requires trusting in oracle, thus it may be reasonable to use multiple oracles.
