## Hiding Malicious Code with External Contract

### Description:
In Solidity any address can be casted into specific contract, even if the contract at the address is not the one being casted. This can be exploited to hide malicious code.

### Remediation:
1. Initialize a new contract inside the constructor
2. Make the address of external contract public so that the code of the external contract can be reviewed
