## Uninitialized Storage Pointer

### Description:
Uninitialized local storage variables can point to unexpected storage locations in the contract, which can lead to intentional or unintentional vulnerabilities.

### Remediation:
Check if the contract requires a storage object as in many situations this is actually not the case. If a local variable is sufficient, mark the storage location of the variable explicitly with the `memory` attribute. If a storage variable is needed then initialise it upon declaration and additionally specify the storage location `storage`.
