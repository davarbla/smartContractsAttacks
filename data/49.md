## Unprotected SELFDESTRUCT Instruction

### Description
Due to missing or insufficient access controls, malicious parties can self-destruct the contract.

### Remediation
Consider removing the self-destruct functionality unless it is absolutely required. If there is a valid use case, it is recommended to implement a multisig scheme so that multiple parties must approve the self-destruct action.
