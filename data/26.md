## Loop through long arrays

### Description:
If you are used to other programming languages you might be tempted to use arrays more than you actually should.

Keep in mind that executing functions in Ethereum costs gas (money), and transactions have a gas limit by definition (the gas limit of a single block). If for some reason your smart contract uses a very long array, and at some point, you need to iterate through it, you might reach the gas limit making the function unexecutable.

### Remediation:
Always try to use mappings when you expect a long list of values.
