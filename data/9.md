## Code With No Effects

### Description:
In Solidity, it's possible to write code that does not produce the intended effects. Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of "dead" code that does not properly performing an intended action.

For example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)("");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-104).

### Remediation:
It's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.
