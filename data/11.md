## Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee

### Description:
There exists a special variant of a message call, named `delegatecall` which is identical to a message call apart from the fact that the code at the target address is executed in the context of the calling contract and `msg.sender` and `msg.value` do not change their values. This allows a smart contract to dynamically load code from a different address at runtime. Storage, current address and balance still refer to the calling contract.

### Remediation:
Use `delegatecall` with caution and make sure to never call into untrusted contracts. If the target address is derived from user input ensure to check it against a whitelist of trusted contracts.
