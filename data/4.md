## Assert Violation:

### Description:

The Solidity assert() function is meant to assert invariants. Properly functioning code should never reach a failing assert statement. A reachable assertion can mean one of two things:

1. A bug exists in the contract that allows it to enter an invalid state;
2. The assert statement is used incorrectly, e.g. to validate inputs.

### Remediation:

Consider whether the condition checked in the assert() is actually an invariant. If not, replace the assert() statement with a require() statement.

If the exception is indeed caused by unexpected behaviour of the code, fix the underlying bug(s) that allow the assertion to be violated.
