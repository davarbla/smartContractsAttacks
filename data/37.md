## Shadowing State Variables

### Description:
Solidity allows for ambiguous naming of state variables when inheritance is used. Contract `A` with a variable `x` could inherit contract `B` which also has a state variable `x` defined. This would result in two separate versions of `x`, one of them being accessed from contract `A` and the other one from contract `B`. In more complex contract systems this condition could go unnoticed and subsequently lead to security issues.

### Remediation:
Review storage variable layouts for your contract systems carefully and remove any ambiguities. Always check for compiler warnings as they can flag the issue within a single contract.
