## Incorrect interface

### Description:
A contract interface defines functions with a different type signature than the implementation, causing two different method id's to be created. As a result, when the interfact is called, the fallback method will be executed.

### Remediation:
Verify that type signatures are identical between inferfaces and implementations.
