## Wrong inheritance

### Description:
Solidity supports multiple inheritance, meaning that one contract can inherit several contracts. Multiple inheritance introduces ambiguity called Diamond Problem: if two or more base contracts define the same function, which one should be called in the child contract? Solidity deals with this ambiguity by using reverse C3 Linearization, which sets a priority between base contracts.

### Remediation:
When inheriting multiple contracts, especially if they have identical functions, a developer should carefully specify inheritance in the correct order. The rule of thumb is to inherit contracts from more /general/ to more /specific/.
