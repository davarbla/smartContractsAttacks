## Floating Pragma

### Description
Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.

### Remediation
Lock the pragma version and also consider known bugs ([https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases)) for the compiler version that is chosen.
