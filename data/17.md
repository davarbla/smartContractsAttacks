## Floating Point Arithmetic

### Description:
As there is no fixed point type in Solidity, developers are required to implement their own using the standard integer data types. There are a number of pitfalls developers can run into during this process. 

### Remediations: 
Keeping the right precision in your smart contracts is very important, especially when dealing ratios and rates which reflect economic decisions.
