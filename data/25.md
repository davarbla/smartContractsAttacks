## Unsafe Ownership Transfer

### Description:
Transferring ownership of your contract, e.g. when transferring governance rights or even changing your proxy admin, itâ€™s scary. If you transfer the rights to the wrong account, you are most likely losing the ownership forever.

### Remediation:
Use an ACK method for approve the new owner.
